# Memory Extraction Criteria

## What is worth remembering?
- Personalized information: Information specific to this user, not general domain knowledge
- Long-term validity: Information that will still be useful in future sessions
- Specific and clear: Has concrete details, not vague generalizations

## What is NOT worth remembering?
- General knowledge: "Personalized service is core to romantic vacations" (domain knowledge, not personalized memory)
- Temporary information: One-time questions or conversations
- Vague information: "User has questions about a feature" (no specific details)

# Memory Classification

## Core Decision Logic

When choosing a category, first ask yourself: What is this information mainly about?

| Question | Answer | Category |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Who is the user? | Identity, attributes | profile |
| What does the user prefer? | Preferences, habits | preferences |
| What is this thing? | Person, project, organization | entities |
| What happened? | Decision, milestone | events |
| How was it solved? | Problem + solution | cases |
| What is the process? | Reusable steps | patterns |

## Precise Definition of Each Category

**profile** - User identity (static attributes)
- Core: Describes "who the user is"
- Test: Can it start with "User is..."

**preferences** - User preferences (tendency choices)
- Core: Describes "user tends to/habits"
- Test: Can it be described as "User prefers/likes..."

**entities** - Entities (continuously existing nouns)
- Core: Describes "current state of something"
- Test: Can it be described as "XXX's state is..."

**events** - Events (things that happened)
- Core: Describes "what happened"
- Test: Can it be described as "XXX did/completed/happened..."

**cases** - Cases (problem + solution)
- Core: Describes "how a specific problem was solved"
- Test: Does it contain "problem -> solution" structure

**patterns** - Patterns (reusable processes)
- Core: Describes "what process to follow in what situation"
- Test: Can it be used for "similar situations"

## Common Confusion Clarification

- "Plan to do X" -> events (action, not entity)
- "Project X status: Y" -> entities (describes entity)
- "User prefers X" -> preferences (not profile)
- "Encountered problem A, used solution B" -> cases (not events)
- "General process for handling certain problems" -> patterns (not cases)

# Three-Level Structure

Each memory contains three levels:

**abstract (L0)**: Index layer, plain text one-liner
- Merge types (preferences/entities/profile/patterns): \`[Merge key]: [Description]\`
  - preferences: \`Python code style: No type hints, concise and direct\`
  - entities: \`OpenViking project: AI Agent long-term memory management system\`
  - profile: \`User basic info: AI development engineer, 3 years experience\`
  - patterns: \`Teaching topic handling: Outline->Plan->Generate PPT\`
- Independent types (events/cases): Specific description
  - events: \`Decided to refactor memory system: Simplify to 5 categories\`
  - cases: \`Band not recognized -> Request member/album/style details\`

**overview (L1)**: Structured summary layer, organized with Markdown headings
- preferences: \`## Preference Domain\` / \`## Specific Preferences\`
- entities: \`## Basic Info\` / \`## Core Attributes\`
- events: \`## Decision Content\` / \`## Reason\` / \`## Result\`
- cases: \`## Problem\` / \`## Solution\`

**content (L2)**: Detailed expansion layer, free Markdown, includes background, timeline, complete narrative

# Output Format

Return JSON:
{
  "memories": [
    {
      "category": "profile|preferences|entities|events|cases|patterns",
      "abstract": "Merge types use [Merge key]: [Description], independent types use specific description",
      "overview": "Structured Markdown, use different heading templates by category",
      "content": "Free Markdown, complete narrative"
    }
  ]
}

Notes:
- Output language should match the dominant language in the conversation
- Only extract truly valuable personalized information
- If nothing worth recording, return {"memories": []}
- Preferences should be aggregated by topic`;
}
